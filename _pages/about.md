I am a dual doctoral student currently pursuing my PhD in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence under the joint supervision of [Dr. Chaklam Silpasuwanchai]([url](http://www.chaklam.com/)) at the[ Asian Institute of Technology (AIT)]([url](https://ait.ac.th/)), Thailand, and [Dr. Ashutosh Modi]((https://ashutosh-modi.github.io/)) at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur]([url](https://www.iitk.ac.in/)), India.

My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), multimodal learning, and medical imaging. I am passionate about developing AI systems that are not only technically sound but also usable, interpretable, and impactful in real clinical workflows.


Currently, I am working on building AI-driven tools for medical imaging and trauma classification, integrating multimodal learning and expert medical knowledge. I collaborate closely with clinicians and radiologists to ensure that the models we develop are both relevant and practical for real-world use.


### Previous Experience

Prior to starting my PhD, I served as a Guest Lecturer at Ewing Christian College, Allahabad, India. During my tenure, I taught a range of multidisciplinary subjects including Image Processing, Statistics, Basic Electronics, and Computer Networking.

This experience not only strengthened my foundational knowledge across various domains but also enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical concepts to diverse student groups. It laid the groundwork for my interest in interdisciplinary research and my passion for education.

### Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy mentoring students, collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, and exploring the evolving frontiers of responsible and human-centered AI. I am also deeply interested in science communication, academic writing, and bridging the gap between technology and society.
